# Supervised-Learning-in-Python

Welcome to the repository for the "Supervised Learning in Python" tutorial video! ðŸš€

This repository contains all the code and dataset used in the video. Follow along to master regression and classification algorithms in Python.

# Repository Structure:
supervised_learning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with complete code examples for regression and classification.

# Topics Covered:
## 1. Linear Regression

Predicting continuous values.
Example: House price prediction based on square footage.

## 2. Logistic Regression
Classifying data into binary categories.
Example: Predicting if a house price is above $200,000.

## 3. Decision Trees
Simple and interpretable classification model.

## 4. Random Forest
Ensemble learning method to improve accuracy.

## 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Finding the optimal boundary for classification tasks.

## Requirements:
Install the required Python libraries before running the code:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

# How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizazahmed14/Supervised-Learning-in-Python
```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
